# Go Movies CRUD

**Go Movies CRUD** is a simple and efficient web application built with Go (Golang) that demonstrates the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing a list of movies. This project serves as a practical example for learning Go and building RESTful APIs.

## Features

- **Create**: Add new movies to the collection with relevant details like title, director, release year, and genre.
- **Read**: View a list of all movies in the collection, or search for specific movies by title or director.
- **Update**: Modify the details of existing movies.
- **Delete**: Remove movies from the collection.
